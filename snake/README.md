CSCI 0300 Project 1 - Snake
===========================

## Design Overview:
The only important decision to highlight for my implementation of snake is the variable head_position in my update function. It's an incredibly important part of my code that I handled really poorly, as it serves as the linchpin for my non-growing snake implementation while also being a hindrance for my growing snake mode, so shadowing the declaration was the ugly choice I made since I don't really have time to fix it :(

## Responsible Computing:
The Unicode Consortium was first started by three members, Joe Becker, Lee Collins, and Mark Davis, but the organization's ranks has grown to include companies with household names like Google, IBM, and Facebook, and includes even the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs of Oman. Ironically, despite their mission to allow the representaation of all kinds of text from all peoples on modern software, their members are mainly tech or software companies, and the members of the Unicode Technical Committee (the people who decide what new characters are added) are almost entirely white, male, Americans. It's no wonder, as members are decided based on paying membership fees instead of selecting or voting on deciding members who might properly represent the people who unicode might affect in conjunction with linguists who might be able to efficiently determine what to add and how. Currently, there is a language called "Loma" which still hasn't been included with about 420,000 native speakers, meaning all of these people do not have any access to online software or communication in their native language. While these people do exist and their suggestions are indeed considered, it still led to the Unihan controversy which threatened to eliminate a lot of the diversity in the local variations of ways to write scripts. While a lot of the article's points are good, I think that the real issue is the manner in which Unicode is trying to record these graphemes. So while I consider Unihan to be a mistake, with the system right now, attempting to record all the various scripts not only for the CJK languages but also for the other grapheme languages is too costly for memory, and so another method must be devised.
